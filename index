			<h1>ROADMEN</h1>
			Roadmen are all very close and see each other as a family. They are willing to go to great lengths for each other. For example, when one member was stabbed by a gang and all his friends helped in the early days of the gang. The gang started from humble beginnings but have since cemented their reputation as a well-known and increasingly respectable gang in Los Santos.

			Roadmen do not officially have the gang's colors, but often wear their custom puffer jackets and their custom chains featuring the British flag. When they first formed, they often wore puffer jackets, but over time, more and more puffer jackets were worn by residents, and they decided to make necklaces as their identity.

When they landed, they started traveling around the city of Los Santos, they were working, etc. Long story short, Kent met Axel William (Bunny) and Carlo there. just a little chat, carlo and bunny went, at one point bunny called kent and told him to meet at vanilla unicorn, and there carlo gave a job to kent car boosting, and kent did it, and after that bunny and carlo agreed to join roadmen, and roadmen formed. and after that they live life like gangsters.

			and once upon a time there was an announcement from Shen Long that there would be an gang meet throughout Los Santos, and Shen Long offered business that the gang who was the first to enter the court, would be given the business of assembling weapons and distributing weapons, and in short the Roadmen who got the table and became the first alley in Los Santos that holds weapon crafting
